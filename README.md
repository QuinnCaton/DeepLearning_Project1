## Caton_Project1.ipynb is the code I used in NN testing using a different feature space
## NN_model.ipynb I used in some preliminary tests to get the original feature space network down to ~5% as well as markdowns to understand the code
## Caton_Project1_wkst.pdf contains a (not-pretty) spreadsheet of my test results
